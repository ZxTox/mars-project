					<h2>Who are We?</h2>
					<p>
						The name of our company is 'MarsMile' and consists of 5 founders:
						Bosmans Randy, Defoor Kobe, Deschoolmeester Dries, Fida Djelal and
						Lemaire Milan.
					</p>
					<p>
						MarsMile wants to offer sustainable transport for inhabitants of
						Earth and Mars who would like to travel between the two planets for
						visiting their family and friends.
					</p>
					<p>
						The distance between the two planets is 54.6 million kilometers at
						their closest point and 401 million kilometers at their maximum
						distance. We specialize in covering this great distance comfortably,
						sustainably and efficiently, hence our name 'MarsMile'.
					</p>
					<p>
						We want to make sure that martians and earthlings can travel in
						comfort and arrive at their destination without any problems.
